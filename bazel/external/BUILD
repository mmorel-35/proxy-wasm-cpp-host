# Note about v8.patch:
# The v8.patch file previously included a patch to change the default value of
# v8_enable_pointer_compression from "none" to "False". This patch has been removed
# in favor of using V8's v8_disable_pointer_compression Starlark transition API.
# See //bazel:v8_transition.bzl for the transition wrapper implementation.
